# STATUS

A running log of what actually works, what's next, and how to run the app.
Updated at the end of every working session.

**Requirement (source of truth):** [`docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`](docs/REQUIREMENTS.md).

## Session 1 — Scaffold + static UI shell

**Done**

- [x] Scaffolded Tauri 2 + React 19 + TypeScript + Vite
- [x] Wired Tailwind CSS v4 (Vite plugin) with the HN Watch design tokens
- [x] Window configured — title "HN Watch", 1160×780, min 900×600
- [x] Project docs seeded: `README.md`, `STATUS.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `docs/architecture.html`
- [x] Static, non-functional UI shell rendering **mock data**:
  - Left sidebar: list of monitors + "New monitor" button (no-op)
  - Center: Twitter-style feed of match cards
  - Slide-over: "Dig deeper" panel with mock agent lanes + a compiled brief
- [x] Verified live: app compiles & launches; feed renders; monitor filtering and
      the dig-deeper panel work (checked against the Vite dev server)
- [x] Git initialised; baseline on `main`; UI built on `feat/ui-shell`, merged via `--no-ff`

**Not yet (intentionally)** — everything below is UI-only mock; no logic behind it:
buttons are no-ops, data is hard-coded, nothing calls Rust or Claude, no persistence.

## Session 2 — Brand icon + project docs

**Done**

- [x] Custom brand mark — bold white "W" on an HN-orange squircle, one source `assets/brand/icon.svg`
- [x] Regenerated the app bundle icon set (dock / Spotlight); replaced the Tauri placeholder
- [x] Sidebar logo Y → W, sized to match the dock icon; updated the `docs/architecture.html` logo
- [x] `docs/design.md` — design-system reference (brand, color tokens, typography, components)
- [x] Captured the verbatim brief in `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`; added root `CLAUDE.md` (auto-loaded
      session context); removed `DECISIONS.md`
- [x] Verified live in the native window; merged `feat/brand-icon` → `main`, pushed to origin

## How to run

```bash
npm install
npm run tauri dev     # opens the native HN Watch window
```

Requires Node 20+, Rust stable, and `claude` on the PATH (used from Phase 3 onward).

**Testing:** test against the **real native app window**, never a browser at localhost — see
[`docs/TESTING.md`](docs/TESTING.md) for the verified computer-use test loop (launch → screenshot →
drive). Verified working end-to-end in Session 1.

## Next — Monitors CRUD + persistence (Phase 2)

- [ ] Define shared types + Tauri command surface (`create_monitor`, `list_monitors`, …)
- [ ] SQLite store in the Rust core; monitors survive restart
- [ ] Wire the sidebar create/edit/delete to real Rust commands
- [ ] Replace mock monitors with live data from the store

## Backlog (later phases)

- [ ] HN ingestion + pre-filter
- [ ] Agent runtime (bounded pool over `claude -p`) + one real monitor tick
- [ ] Background workers, dedup, tray, native notifications
- [ ] Dig-deeper swarm: parallel `claude -p`, live streaming → compiled brief
- [ ] Error handling, polish, design write-up in README

_Workflow: each phase is built on its own `feat/*` branch and merged into `main`._
